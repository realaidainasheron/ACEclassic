**ClassicACE is an Asheron's Call Emulator based on ACEmulator. It adds rulesets which change the gameplay rules:**
- *Infiltration Ruleset:* Replicates the gameplay of the Infiltration event which was released by Turbine in February 2005.
- *CustomDM Ruleset:* A variation of the Infiltration ruleset with a lot of tweaks and changes, a truly custom Asheron's Call experience.
- *EoR Ruleset:* End of Release - replicates the gameplay as it was at the time Asheron's Call was sunsetted. This is ACEmulator's default behavior and is included here for completeness and code compatibility.
